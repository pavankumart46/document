### Types of Menus

A menu is a set of options. The user can select from a menu to perform a function, for example searching for information, saving information, editing information, or navigating to a screen. The figure below shows the types of menus that the Android system offers.

  1. Options menu: Appears in the app bar and provides the primary options that affect use of the app itself. Examples of menu options: Search to perform a search, Share to share a link, and Settings to navigate to a Settings Activity.
  2. Contextual menu: Appears as a floating list of choices when the user performs a long tap on an element on the screen. Examples of menu options: Edit to edit the element, Delete to delete it, and Share to share it over social media.
  3. Contextual action bar: Appears at the top of the screen overlaying the app bar, with action items that affect the selected element or elements. Examples of menu options: Edit, Share, and Delete for one or more selected elements.
  4. Popup menu: Appears anchored to a View such as an ImageButton, and provides an overflow of actions or the second part of a two-part command. Example of a popup menu: the Gmail app anchors a popup menu to the app bar for the message view with Reply, Reply All, and Forward.
