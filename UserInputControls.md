## Input controls

This chapter introduces the Android _input controls_. Input controls are interactive elements in your app's UI that accept data input. Users input data to apps by entering text or numbers into fields using the on-screen keyboard. Users also select options from checkboxes, radio buttons, and drop-down menus, and they change settings and turn on or turn off certain features.

Android provides a variety of input controls for your UI. The figure below shows some popular ones.
