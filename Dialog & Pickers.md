## Dialogs and pickers

A dialog is a window that appears on top of the display or fills the display, interrupting the flow of _Activity_. Dialogs inform users about a specific task and may contain critical information, require decisions, or involve multiple tasks.

For example, an alert dialog might require the user to click **Continue** after reading it, or give the user a choice to agree with an action by clicking a positive button (such as **OK** or **Accept**), or to disagree by clicking a negative button (such as **Cancel**).

You can also use a dialog to provide choices in the style of radio buttons, as shown on the right side of the figure below.
