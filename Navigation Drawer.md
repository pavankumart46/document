## Navigation drawer

A navigation drawer is a panel that usually displays navigation options on the left edge of the screen, as shown on the right side of the figure below. It is hidden most of the time, but is revealed when the user swipes a finger from the left edge of the screen or touches the navigation icon in the app bar, as shown on the left side of the figure below.

A good example of a navigation drawer is in the Gmail app, which provides access to the inbox, labeled email folders, and settings. The best practice for employing a navigation drawer is to provide descendant navigation from the parent Activity to all of the other child screens in an app. It can display many navigation targets at onceâ€”for example, it can contain buttons (like a dashboard), tabs, or a list of items (like the Gmail drawer).
